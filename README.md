# SLPMods Launcher
## This Repository is until i decide to change it discontinued no support or active bugfixes will be given or made
The SLPMods Launcher is officially developed for the german gaming network [SLPNetwork](https://slpnetwork.tk).
This Repo will always be the Development Repo of this launcher, this means it may contain major bugs and may not always be stable.

## Features
1. It's Opensource! Means someone did the development work for you.
2. Its settings do contain everything the user will need and are continuously expanding.
3. Due to its JSON server backend, it's easy to create new mod pack items.

## Setting the launcher up
The Tutorial has been Moved to [The Wiki](https://github.com/steevLP/slpmodslauncher/wiki)

## Left Todo
I will Probably implement it in the official Version sooner or later but here are some Ideas what you  may do yourself :D
1. Multilanguage Support
2. Displaying Profile on mainscreen
3. Implement Multy OS Support
4. Private pack codes
5. Since my Method of making an Auto Updater Seems to fail now because of some reason i do not know if it works for the Launcher. so yeh proving that it does would be a good step i think.
